$Pritf project 
The project is done by Mariam and Ernest.
We are to create our own printf without the standard input output library.
It must be able to return the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings)
The printf must be able to handle the c, s, d, i, x, X, b, %, conversion specifiers.
In the task 0, we are supposed to create our printf to handle the conversion specifiers c, s, 
and % using the write function only, to print output to the standard output. 
The printf function should be able to convert decimal to binary.
